# DatabaseAndAPIs
 
- This project is a simple demonstration of using databases and APIs to create a web application. </br>
- It involves creating a database using MongoDB, populating it with data, and then creating an API using Node.js and Express.js that serves the data to a web application.
- The project is divided into three parts, with each part added more functionality and endpoints.

## The following technologies were used to create this project:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## API Endpoints

This application provides set of API endpoints, some of them API endpoints:

`GET /api/v1/nfts` : Returns a list of all NFTs in the database.<br/>
`GET /api/v1/nfts/:id` : Returns details of a specific NFT.<br/>
`GET /api/v1/users` : Returns a list of all users in the database.<br/>
